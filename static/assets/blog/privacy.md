Speaking of which. From a security standpoint this project represents about as much trouble to an individual to deal with a bad actor as it is to companies like Rackspace and Amazon that have to deal with a multitude of them more often. Bad actors are going to start servers. Bad actors are going to run appliances. Bad actors are going to try to hack your systems. It's this project's job to figure out how to minimize the impact of bad actors in the overall system without having the expectation set that we're someday going to be able to stop all all of them from doing anything bad forever. We're not.

Speaking of which about the duplicity of privacy, the general idea is that privacy is actually transparency and anonymity squashed together like the polar ends of a giant super emotional magnet. They may be touching, but they slip around real quick and get pissed off if you move too fast. On one side you have transparency and the trust it represents. If you are transparent, there has to be a way for me to trust you are reporting a truth. This establishment of trust, in some cases complete transparency, can now be done in a computed way using blockchain technologies.

Anonymity, on the other hand, isn't really about trust. Well, it is, but it's more about the fact you trust that I don't know anything about you when you desire privacy. It's self trust that gives that semblance of privacy to you, and it's something that I think runs to the core of our existences, which hopefully indicates that the desire of privacy isn't something that implies a wrong or right.

There are clearly wrong things that people do in the world. I'm no exception. Sometimes you don't think of someone else because you decide nobody is listening to you, so fuck it, and you go and do a bad thing. Then things get complicated because maybe you liked it. From a computer security standpoint, we really don't give a fuck why you did that bad thing you did. We just want to fix it and get back to bed as fast as possible.

There are clearly right things that people do in the world that some other people don't agree with. There are things that over 50% of the people in the world believe is a good thing that another 25% think is a bad thing. There are no statements of absolute truth here like there was with transparency. Here, it's about how you feel about something, or what your opinion is about it. Privacy gives you the right to say how you feel, and your own personal truth, in a meaningful and transparent way.

I think those are the principles in what the United States was originally founded on. I think we've forgotten some of the basics along the way in our attempts to fend off cognitive dissonece regarding the amount of work required to get rid of something 100% of the way. Forever.

People with opinions that differ from yours are not bad people by default, but they might be. Both of them have a right to defend their privacy from you. You also have a right to know more about them if that is your intent.

Security on Stackmonkey will be done by the community, for the community. White lists, black lists, voting buttons, voting Bitcoin addresses, bitcoin contracted bounties, and anything and everything we need to do to ensure we get a good night's rest; most nights, but occasionally Sunday mornings at 3AM. Expect streams of server starts, ask prices, bids, URLs used for boots, and general appliance statistics all open and transparently available on the pool controllers.

Infrastructure was meant to be open and transparent so people could enjoy paying for privacy. Help keep it that way by donating your time to the project.

I'm not a crypto, but I can speak to it.

The way I've been casting it is as follows.  There are three knobs to the cloud currently: storage, compute and network.  Blockchain 
technologies essentially embody computed trust, in as much as the information on the blockchain is trusted to be a fair an accurate representation of a value store.  I like to think compute was scrunched into trust, sorta like compute scrunches data off the network into compressed storage.

So now we have compute, storage, network and trust.  Think about privacy.  Privacy is 100% inverted trust - you know I don't know you because I can't read your storage, network or compute layers.  You pay for this privacy by paying for compute to encrypt the data.  The more you pay, the more secure you are (or as secure as one would hope for).  This usually involves buying your own hardware, for obvious reasons.

There also exist use cases  that don't require trust.  Streaming Netflix videos.  Their data is already encrypted and simply dishes content up to a device that has already authenticated and secured the decryption keys for the content.  Netflix doesn't care if you have their data - people get their data all the time.  Perfect use case for untrusted compute.

Now, divide the groups who provide the infrastructure services into two groups.  A group you trust and a group you don't trust.  Run things you can't secure on the group you trust's hardware.

This is where homomorphic encryption comes in.  It allows me to run trusted compute jobs on untrusted hardware.
